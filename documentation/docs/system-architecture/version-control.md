# Version Control

## GitHub
* Every trace of user activity is recorded through Git & GitHub.

* Git can only be acknowledged with respect to each individual account; portrayed by the commits themselves.

* In order to determine who worked on what, GitHub will act as a compilation of each additional comit.

* There are different branches included to determine each step, and how they build up to the main branch.

* As expected, the pull requests will consist of reviews focusing on constructive criticism.
