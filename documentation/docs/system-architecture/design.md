## 1. Purpose

Feedstack is designed to provide clear, actionable feedback on web designs. Users upload their design files and receive structured insights that help improve usability, visual consistency, and overall user experience. The system is built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend, and it leverages modern design analysis techniques to generate feedback that is both practical and easy to understand.

This document outlines the architecture of Feedstack by detailing its components, the flow of data, and the methods used to generate and display feedback. Our goal is to create a scalable, maintainable solution that meets the needs of designers and developers alike.

## 2. System Overview and Architecture

Feedstack’s architecture is organized into three main areas:

1. **Client Application (Frontend):** The user interface where designs are uploaded and feedback is displayed.
2. **Backend Services:** The server-side logic that processes uploads, generates feedback, and manages user data.
3. **External Services:** Third-party APIs and storage systems that enhance the system’s functionality.

### 2.1 System Architecture Diagram

Below is the system architecture diagram that shows how the main components interact:

### 2.2 System Components and Interfaces

#### Client Application (Frontend - React)
The frontend is the face of Feedstack. It provides a simple, responsive interface for uploading designs and viewing feedback.

- **Interfaces:**
  - REST API calls to submit designs and fetch feedback.
  - Real-time updates via WebSockets.
  - State management handled through Redux or Zustand.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Design Upload:** Users can easily upload and preview their design files.
  - **Feedback Display:** Feedback is organized into themed sections for clarity.
  - **Interactive Chat:** An interface allows users to ask questions and receive further insights.
  - **Keyword Highlighting:** Important design terms are identified and emphasized.

#### Backend Services (Django)
The backend is the heart of Feedstack. It processes design files, coordinates with external analysis tools, and organizes feedback for display.

- **Interfaces:**
  - RESTful API endpoints for communication with the frontend.
  - Integration with external analysis services for processing design files.
  - Database communication via PostgreSQL.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Design Processor:** Validates uploads, processes files, and coordinates analysis.
  - **Feedback Generator:** Collects and formats feedback from external services.
  - **User Management:** Handles authentication and user data.
  - **Theme Categorizer:** Sorts feedback into design themes (e.g., accessibility, color contrast).

#### External Services
Feedstack integrates with external systems to enhance its capabilities.

- **Design Analysis API:** Processes design files and returns detailed feedback based on established best practices.
- **Storage Solutions:** Systems like Firebase are used to store feedback and interaction data securely.

## 3. Data Flow and Use Cases

### 3.1 Uploading a Design for Feedback
1. A user uploads a design file via the web interface.
2. The frontend sends the file to the backend using a REST API call.
3. The backend validates the file and sends it to the design analysis API.
4. The API returns detailed feedback, which is then categorized.
5. The feedback is stored in the database and displayed on the frontend.

### 3.2 Processing and Categorizing Feedback
1. The backend receives raw feedback from the analysis API.
2. The theme categorizer organizes the feedback into relevant design categories.
3. Key design elements are highlighted for emphasis.
4. The final, structured feedback is saved and provided to the user.

## 4. Methods and Analysis Integration

### 4.1 Feedback Generation
The system uses advanced analysis techniques to generate feedback on uploaded designs. The process includes:
- Preprocessing the design file.
- Analyzing the design using an external service.
- Returning structured feedback that highlights areas for improvement.

### 4.2 Theme Categorization
Feedback is organized into themes by extracting key design terms and mapping them to predefined categories such as accessibility, visual hierarchy, and color contrast. This helps designers quickly identify areas that need attention.

### 4.3 Keyword Highlighting
To improve readability, key terms are automatically highlighted within the feedback. This is achieved by identifying important design-related keywords and displaying them in a visually distinct manner, making it easier for users to understand the suggestions.

## 5. Development Environment and Version Control

### 5.1 Development Environment
- **Frontend:** React, Redux/Zustand, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Django, PostgreSQL.
- **Analysis Tools:** External design analysis API.
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerization; hosting on a cloud platform.
- **Testing:** Jest for the frontend; Pytest for the backend.

### 5.2 Version Control and CI/CD
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub.
- **Branching Strategy:** Feature-based branches with pull requests.
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Security:** Secure API communication and JWT-based authentication.

## 6. Architecture Compliance Checklist

- **Clear Component Definitions:** Each part of the system has a well-defined role.
- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to grow with user needs.
- **Security:** User data and communications are protected through modern authentication and validation techniques.
- **Performance:** Optimized for fast responses through efficient state management and database indexing.
- **User Experience:** Real-time updates and interactive elements are implemented to ensure a smooth user experience.


This document will evolve with Feedstack’s development, ensuring that the architecture remains **robust, scalable, and adaptable**.
