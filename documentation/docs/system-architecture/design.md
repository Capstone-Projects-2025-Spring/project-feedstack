## 1. Purpose

Feedstack is a web-based tool designed to provide structured feedback on web and app designs. By allowing users to upload design files, the system generates categorized insights that help improve usability, consistency, and accessibility. The platform is built using Django for backend processing and React for the frontend interface, ensuring a scalable and efficient solution.

This document outlines the architectural foundation of Feedstack, detailing its key components, data flow, and system interactions. The primary objective is to establish a robust and maintainable framework that supports real-time feedback generation and future scalability.

## 2. System Overview and Architecture

Feedstack's architecture is divided into three primary areas:

1. **Client Application (Frontend):** The user-facing web interface where designs are uploaded, feedback is reviewed, and interactive features enhance the user experience.
2. **Backend Services:** The core processing layer that handles file uploads, communicates with external analysis tools, and categorizes the feedback.
3. **External Services:** APIs and cloud storage that assist in design analysis and persistent data management.

### 2.1 System Components and Interfaces

#### **Client Application (Frontend - React)**
The frontend provides a streamlined interface where users can interact with the system efficiently.

- **Interfaces:**
  - REST API endpoints for uploading designs and retrieving feedback.
  - WebSockets for handling real-time updates.
  - State management via Redux or Zustand for optimal application performance.

- **Core Functionalities:**
  - **Design Upload:** Users can upload and preview design files.
  - **Feedback Display:** AI-generated feedback is structured into categorized sections.
  - **Interactive Chat:** Users can request additional clarification or insights.
  - **Keyword Highlighting:** Key design terms are identified for better readability.

#### **Backend Services (Django)**
The backend is responsible for handling user requests, processing design files, and managing feedback generation.

- **Interfaces:**
  - REST API to manage frontend communication.
  - Integration with external analysis services to evaluate design files.
  - PostgreSQL database for storing user data and feedback.

- **Core Components:**
  - **Design Processor:** Handles file validation, storage, and analysis requests.
  - **Feedback Generator:** Collects and refines AI-generated feedback.
  - **User Management:** Manages authentication and session handling.
  - **Theme Categorizer:** Sorts feedback into predefined design categories.

#### **External Services**
Feedstack integrates external tools to enhance its functionality.

- **Design Analysis API:** Evaluates design files and returns structured feedback.
- **Cloud Storage Solutions:** Stores user-uploaded designs and processed feedback securely.

## 3. Data Flow and Use Cases

### **3.1 Uploading a Design for Feedback**
1. The user selects a design file and uploads it via the web interface.
2. The frontend validates the file format and size before sending it to the backend.
3. The backend verifies the file and forwards it to the analysis service.
4. The external analysis service generates feedback and returns it to the backend.
5. The backend categorizes the feedback and stores it in the database.
6. The frontend retrieves the categorized feedback and presents it to the user.

### **3.2 Processing and Categorizing Feedback**
1. The backend receives raw feedback from the external analysis service.
2. The **Theme Categorizer** processes the feedback, classifying it into predefined categories.
3. Key UX terms are identified and highlighted for better comprehension.
4. The processed feedback is stored in the database and sent back to the frontend.
5. Users can interact with the feedback through an organized interface.

## 4. Methods and Processing Logic

### **4.1 Feedback Generation**
Feedstack processes design uploads through an external analysis service. The system ensures feedback is structured, relevant, and categorized based on UX/UI best practices.

### **4.2 Theme Categorization**
The system analyzes feedback to classify it into **design categories** such as **Accessibility, Visual Hierarchy, and Color Contrast**, ensuring that users can easily identify areas that need improvement.

### **4.3 Keyword Highlighting**
To enhance readability, key UX terms in the feedback are automatically highlighted. The system identifies important design-related phrases and presents them in a way that helps users quickly grasp suggestions.

## 5. Development Environment and Version Control

### **5.1 Development Stack**
- **Frontend:** React, Redux/Zustand, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Django, PostgreSQL.
- **External Processing Tools:** APIs for design evaluation.
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerization.
- **Testing:** Jest for frontend, Pytest for backend.

### **5.2 Version Control and CI/CD**
- **Version Control:** Managed via Git and GitHub.
- **Branching Strategy:** Feature-based branches with code reviews and pull requests.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment workflows.
- **Security Measures:** API security through JWT authentication and request validation.

## 6. Architecture Compliance Checklist

- **Well-Defined System Components:** Each section has a clear role and responsibility.
- **Scalability Considerations:** The system is designed to handle increasing user demand.
- **Security Measures in Place:** API authentication and secure data handling.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient state management and optimized database queries.
- **User Experience Enhancements:** Features such as real-time updates improve usability.
