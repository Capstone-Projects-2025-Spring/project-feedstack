# Feedstack: Architectural Overview  

## 1. Purpose  

Feedstack is a multimodal AI-driven feedback system designed to analyze and enhance web and app designs by providing structured, theme-based insights. Utilizing **Django (Python)** for backend processing, **React (JavaScript)** for frontend interactivity, and **OpenAI’s GPT-4o API**, Feedstack enables users to:  

- Upload design files  
- Receive AI-generated feedback  
- Visualize insights in an interactive format  

The system categorizes feedback into predefined design themes such as **Accessibility, Visual Hierarchy, Color Contrast, and Consistency**, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation.  

This document outlines the **technical structure and component interactions** of Feedstack, providing a comprehensive mapping between requirements and implementation. It details **system components, data flow, algorithms, and development considerations** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and alignment with user needs.

## 2. System Components and Interfaces  

Feedstack follows a **modular architecture**, allowing efficient scaling and future enhancements. The system consists of three primary components:  

1. **Client (Frontend - React.js)**  
2. **Server (Backend - Django/Python)**  
3. **Database (PostgreSQL & Embeddings Engine)**  

---

### 2.1 Client (Frontend - React.js)  

The frontend serves as the **primary user interface**, enabling users to upload design files, interact with the **AI-powered chatbot**, and explore structured feedback in an intuitive manner.  

#### **Interfaces:**  
- **REST API** endpoints to send design uploads and retrieve feedback  
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates and UI enhancements  
- **State management** using **Redux/Zustand** to optimize user interactions  

#### **Core Functionalities:**  
- **Design Upload Module**: Facilitates user uploads and previews  
- **Feedback Visualization**: Dynamically generates accordions based on AI-categorized themes  
- **Keyword Highlighting**: Extracts and visually emphasizes design-related terms in feedback  

---

### 2.2 Server (Backend - Django/Python)  

The backend is responsible for **processing user uploads, generating AI-driven feedback**, and structuring insights into **predefined design themes**. It integrates **machine learning models and embeddings** to enhance theme identification accuracy.  

#### **Interfaces:**  
- **REST API** for handling user requests and feedback retrieval  
- **Integration with OpenAI’s GPT-4o API** for design analysis  
- **PostgreSQL database** interactions for storing design feedback and embeddings  

#### **Core Components:**  
- **FeedbackProcessor**: Manages AI-generated insights and structures responses  
- **ThemeCategorizer**: Classifies feedback into UX/UI design themes  
- **KeywordExtractor**: Identifies and highlights key UX terminology  
- **DatabaseManager**: Handles data persistence and retrieval  

---

### 2.3 Database (PostgreSQL & Embeddings Engine)  

The database stores **user interactions, design feedback, and embeddings** for keyword recognition. It ensures **fast retrieval** and **accurate mapping** of feedback to design themes.  

#### **Entity Relationships:**  
- **Users** (user_id, email, registration_date)  
- **Designs** (design_id, user_id, file_path, timestamp)  
- **Feedback** (feedback_id, design_id, theme, AI-generated message)  
- **Embeddings** (keyword, vector representation)  

#### **Table Design Considerations:**  
- **Optimized indexing** for quick feedback retrieval  
- **Foreign key constraints** ensuring data integrity between user uploads and AI feedback  
- **Embedding storage** for improved keyword mapping to UX themes
