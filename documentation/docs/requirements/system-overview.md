## Abstract

**Feedstack** is an **AI-powered design feedback system** that provides structured insights on uploaded designs. It analyzes key elements such as:
- **Accessibility**
- **Usability**
- **Color Contrast**
- **Visual Hierarchy**

Designed to assist **UI/UX designers, developers, and accessibility specialists**, Feedstack helps refine digital interfaces by offering **AI-generated structured feedback**.

The purpose of **Feedstack** is to bridge the gap between **design evaluation and AI-driven recommendations**. By leveraging **OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API**, Feedstack:
- **Analyzes design structures**
- **Identifies usability concerns**
- **Provides recommendations for improvement**

The system is tailored for professionals who seek **structured feedback** to enhance their **digital interfaces**.

## High-Level Requirement

Feedstack is focused on **AI-assisted design feedback** but **does not replace manual expert reviews**. Instead, it **enhances** the design evaluation process with:
- **Structured AI-powered suggestions**
- **Interactive feedback discussions**
- **Seamless design refinement workflows**

## Conceptual Design

Future updates may include:
- **Deeper integration with design tools** (e.g., **Figma**)
- **Real-time design editing capabilities**
- **Collaboration features for design teams**

## Required Resources

To build and run Feedstack, the following resources are required:
- **AI Model**: OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 Vision API
- **Hosting & Cloud Services**: Grok, Vercel, and Netlify
- **Frontend Framework**: React for responsive and dynamic UI
- **Backend & API**: Django REST Framework
- **Database**: Firebase for data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT

## Background and References

Feedstack is inspired by the growing need for **automated yet intelligent design evaluation tools**. Many UI/UX professionals rely on manual reviews, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent. By leveraging AI, Feedstack aims to **streamline design assessments while maintaining high-quality insights**.
