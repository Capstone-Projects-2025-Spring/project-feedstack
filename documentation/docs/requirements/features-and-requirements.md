# Features and Requirements

### **8\. Testing Requirements**

#### **8.1 Unit Testing**

* **Objective:** Ensure individual components and functions operate correctly in isolation.  
* **Scope:**  
  * Frontend components (React): Test UI elements, state management, and form validation.  
  * Backend APIs (Django REST): Test API endpoints, request handling, and data validation.  
* **Tools:** Jest for frontend testing, PyTest for backend testing.  
* **Key Metrics:**  
  * Identification and resolution of component-specific errors.

#### **8.2 Integration Testing**

* **Objective:** Verify the seamless interaction between frontend and backend components.  
* **Scope:**  
  * Ensure API calls return the correct data and handle error scenarios gracefully.  
  * Test user authentication flows, including session management.  
  * Verify consistent data rendering between backend responses and frontend UI updates.  
* **Tools:** Cypress for end-to-end testing, Postman for API integration testing.  
* **Key Metrics:**  
  * Successful completion of at least 90% of integration test cases.  
  * Minimal frontend-backend data synchronization issues.

#### **8.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

* **Objective:** Validate that the system meets user expectations and functional requirements.  
* **Scope:**  
  * Core features, including design upload, AI-powered feedback generation, and interactive chat.  
  * Usability tests to ensure an intuitive and responsive user experience.  
  * Collaborative mode testing for multi-user scenarios.  
* **Testing Approach:**  
  * Engage a diverse group of target users for feedback.  
  * Use predefined test scripts to guide the evaluation process.  
  * Document and prioritize user-reported issues for resolution.  
* **Success Criteria:**  
  * At least 95% of core features pass UAT without critical issues.  
  * Positive user feedback regarding system usability and feature effectiveness.

  ### **9\. Deployment Requirements**

#### **9.1 Production Setup**

* **Static Files Collection:**

Execute the command to gather static files for efficient serving in production:  
`python manage.py collectstatic`

* **Database Migrations:**

Apply all necessary database migrations to ensure schema alignment:  
`python manage.py migrate`

* **Application Server:**

Launch the application using Gunicorn as the production server:  
`gunicorn feedstack_project.wsgi:application`

#### **9.2 Environment Configuration**

* **Environment Variables:**  
  * Store and manage sensitive configuration details in environment variables, such as:  
    * `SECRET_KEY`  
    * Database connection credentials  
    * API keys for GPT-4 Vision and Firebase  
* **Environment Setup:**  
  * Use `.env` files for local development and environment-specific configurations.

#### **9.3 Security Configuration**

* **HTTPS Configuration:**  
  * Enable HTTPS for secure communication using SSL/TLS certificates.  
* **Firewall and Security Groups:**  
  * Set up firewall rules to restrict unauthorized access to production servers.  
* **Django Security Settings:**  
  * Set `DEBUG = False` in production.  
  * Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to whitelist valid domains.  
  * Use `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`, `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`.
