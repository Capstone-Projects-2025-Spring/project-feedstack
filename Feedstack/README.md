## Project Overview

This tool leverages advanced AI technology to provide comprehensive feedback on design inputs, both textual and visual. The primary objective is to enhance the design process for users by integrating OpenAI's GPT-4V model, which offers detailed and actionable feedback based on user-uploaded designs.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Django, providing a robust and scalable backend service.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4V to process text and image inputs, generating insightful feedback.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple and intuitive interface for uploading designs and receiving feedback.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing user loads and data volumes efficiently.
