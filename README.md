## Keywords

Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Abstract

Feedstack is a multimodal AI-powered feedback system designed to provide tailored insights on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designs. Built using Django, React, Python, and OpenAI's API, the platform allows designers to upload web and app designs, receive AI-generated feedback, and refine their work through an interactive chatbot interface.

The system enables participants to log in with an ID and upload a web design image. The uploaded design is displayed on the left, while an AI-driven chatbot on the right provides context-aware feedback based on UX principles, design heuristics, and accessibility guidelines. Feedback is structured into interactive accordions, with each accordion categorized under a predefined design theme (e.g., Accessibility, Visual Hierarchy, Color Contrast, Consistency, Responsive Design, Usability, and Aesthetic Appeal).

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
